My solution for Kaggle-Walmart Recruting competition.

1. Run merge.R file to merge all 'csv' files: features, stores, train, test into trainMerged.csv and testMerged.csv for data analysis.

2. Main program "main.py" will engineer new features such as types of stores, high weekly-sales months and holidays.

3. funcs.py and load_data.py contains functions supporting main program.

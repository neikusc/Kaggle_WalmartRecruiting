My solution for Kaggle-Walmart Recruiting competition.

1. Run merge.R file to merge all 'csv' files: {features, stores, train, test} into trainMerged.csv and testMerged.csv for later analysis.

2. Main program "main.py" will engineer new features such as types of stores, months with high weekly-sales and holidays, ...

3. funcs.py and load_data.py contain functions which are called in the main program.


Results for each model:

a. ETS ((Error-Trend-Seasonal or ExponenTial Smoothing): 2914.54504
b. ARIMA model: 2919.96171
c. Naive model: 3040.06382
d. Gradien Boosting: 2914.54504

A straight forward average of 4 models gives: 2780.97862 at place 46/694
